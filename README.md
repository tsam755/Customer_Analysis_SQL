## üìä Overview
This project aims to analyze various business data to provide insights into customer behavior, sales performance, and product trends. Using SQL queries, we address questions regarding customer purchase patterns, sales performance by stock group, supplier sales, and delivery methods. The project includes both **Descriptive Analysis** and **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, with insights aimed at improving business strategies.

## üéØ Objectives
- **Question 1**: Calculate the **average order value** for each customer in 2016, with results ordered by the highest average spending.
- **Question 2**: Identify the stock groups with the highest total sales from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2016.
- **Question 3**: List **suppliers** and their total sales year-to-date, including those with zero sales.
- **Question 4**: Analyze **preferred delivery methods** for sales and purchases, showing counts for each delivery method.
- **Question 5**: Identify customers who purchased the most **diverse range of products** in 2016, based on product diversity and total spending.
- **Question 6**: Detail the purchases of the **top 5 high-value customers**, including the total quantity and amount spent on each product.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Data Analysis
- The analysis uses **SQL** to join multiple tables (Sales, Orders, Customers, Suppliers) to compute the requested metrics.
- Key metrics include **total sales per supplier**, **average order value per customer**, and **quantity sold per continent**.

## üîç Key Insights
- **Customer Spending**: Customers with the highest average order value in 2016 tend to have a significant impact on overall revenue.
- **Supplier Sales**: The analysis of supplier sales highlights the importance of tracking underperforming suppliers for potential optimization.
- **Stock Group Performance**: Identifying top-performing stock groups by total sales helps in strategizing stock management.
- **Delivery Methods**: The company can optimize its delivery methods based on sales and purchase patterns.
- **Product Diversity**: Customers with the most diverse purchases help the company understand consumer preferences and identify cross-selling opportunities.

## üîß Tools Used
- **SQL** for querying relational databases and calculating the required metrics.
- **Data from multiple tables** (Sales, Orders, InvoiceLines, Customers, Suppliers, etc.) to perform comprehensive analysis.

## üí° Recommendations
- **For Suppliers**: Engage more actively with underperforming suppliers and assess the products that have zero sales for strategic decision-making.
- **For Delivery Methods**: Optimize the delivery methods used based on frequency and effectiveness in both sales and purchasing.
- **For Product Management**: Prioritize stock groups and products with the highest profit margin and quantity growth.
